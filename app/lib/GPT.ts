  "If you are going to work with any developer on Upwork, make sure it is Aaron. Why should you work with Aaron? 1) He has the ability to work on projects both from the very ground up, but also with established code bases. He is a great problem solver, and will always find a solution. 2) He is not only a good coder, but an excellent communicator and mentor. Aaron has spent many hours upskilling me on dev ops, code bases and more. 3) He can work well as a solo dev, but also integrates well with your existing dev teams and stakeholders. He's been great helping our junior team members with their knowledge gaps. 4) He is a pleasure to work with. Just a good guy all round." - Lockpick Games
  
  "Working with Aaron has been a real pleasure. From the creative introduction, Aaron caught my attention by sending a video of himself talking about the project and the services we could provide. Fully understanding what we wanted to accomplish. Needless to say, we hired him. The contract was for a streamlined Progressive Web App to be used in connection with our board games. The application needed to be both visually appealing, responsive and contain an admin for us to moderate the game mechanics. Aaron delivered exactly what we requested. On time and with excellent results." - Nangarra Games`;
