# Welcome

This is your app. There are many like it, but this one it yours.

## App directory structure

### Paths compile to routes

The paths in the app directory are compiled (by Next.js) into routes.
**Example:** If you want a login page at `example.com/login`, then you can add a page file here: `app/login/page.tsx`

### Layouts wrap pages

Files named `layout.tsx` wrap adjacent and descendant pages
**Example:** You can add a header to the layout in `app/layout.tsx`, and a sidebar in `app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx`
