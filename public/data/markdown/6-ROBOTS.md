# ROBOTS.md

The web app has been initialized with `npx create-next-app@latest`.
This ROBOTS file is located at `roadmap/ROBOTS.md`. The roadmap directory is in the root of the Next.js repository.

## Overview

The files in the roadmap directory should all be copied into their corresponding file paths in the next.js repo. Ie the file at `roadmap/app/globals.css` should be copied to `app/globals.css`, replacing any existing file at that location.

After copying the files listed below, confirm that the environment variables listed below are present - if not, request them from the user. If possible, search the latest documentation for the corresponding platforms to find out how to find the environment variables.

Once the environment variables are set and the files are in place, run the commands listed below to initialize the database and any integrations.
