Before copying files, ensure the target Next.js project has been initialized:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
```

The `create-next-app` initialization should include:
- TypeScript support
- Tailwind CSS
- App Router (not Pages Router)
- ESLint configuration

After initialization, you can proceed with copying the generated files.
