# Tasks

- Add route protection beyond hook response redirection
- make unauthenticated errors silent when not critical
- update the signup to resend the verify email and redirect to the verify page if an account with that email already exists and is not verified
- Update the supabase phase of the starter kit plan to pull and push the config with default settings and the site url and redirect urls with glob endings (eg "localhost:3000/\*\*")
