# Tasks

- Add route protection beyond hook response redirection
- make unauthenticated errors silent when not critical
- update the signup to resend the verify email and redirect to the verify page if an account with that email already exists and is not verified
- update the sign in hook to invalidate the auth query cache on sign in
