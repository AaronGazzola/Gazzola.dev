Title: Beep.Buzz
Description: beep.buzz is a morse code learning platform that teaches through real-time competition (beep for dit, buzz for dah). Users progress through structured mini-game lessons covering letters, numbers, and common words, unlocking ranks as they advance. The core mechanic is realtime competitive mini-games, scored on speed and accuracy. Asynchronous practice lets users send morse messages to others at their skill level, with recipients decoding and replying. Leaderboards track encoding and decoding WPM separately, with weekly ladders and seasonal challenges. Streaks, XP, and achievements drive retention.
