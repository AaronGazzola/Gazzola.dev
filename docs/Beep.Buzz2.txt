Title: Beep.Buzz
Description: beep.buzz is a morse code learning platform that teaches through real-time competition. Users progress through structured lessons covering letters, numbers, and common words, unlocking ranks as they advance. The core mechanic is live dueling: two players see the same prompt and race to tap it out in morse (beep for dit, buzz for dah), scored on speed and accuracy. Asynchronous practice lets users send morse messages to others at their skill level, with recipients decoding and replying. Leaderboards track encoding and decoding WPM separately, with weekly ladders and seasonal challenges. Streaks, XP, and achievements drive retention. The social pressure of communicating with real people accelerates learning beyond solo flashcard apps.
