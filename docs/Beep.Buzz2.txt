Title: Beep.Buzz
Description: beep.buzz is a morse code learning platform that teaches through real-time competition (beep for dit, buzz for dah).
The core UX is a playful UX with a blob shaped character on the left (beep) and a spikey character on the right (buzz) - the characters speak to each other in morse code and the user is tasked with translating. This interface is used for training, where one character will speak a letter, word or sentence (depending on difficulty), which is hown in a speak bubble with the translation and played in the computer audio, the user then clicks a button and the speach bubble disappears and they are required to repeat the letter/word/sentence using the mouse or keyboard to input the morse code signal. The same interface is used for practice, in which one character speaks text or morse code only, without showing the translation, and the user is required to translate either into text or into morse code. The same interface is used for user to user compeition, where users are matched on skill level and send messages back and forth using a similar approach to the practice mode gameplay (beep is the signed in user, buzz is the other user).
Users gain points from each of the gameplay types (training, practice, compeition), and progress through levels which are used for ranked match making in the competition gameplay.
