=== STEP 1: APP INFORMATION ===

Title: Beep.Buzz

Description: beep.buzz is a simple and playful social media platform where users create personalized pages at their own subdomain (username.beep.buzz). Each page is a customizable, vertically-scrolling canvas containing text, shapes, patterns, digital illustrations, and embedded YouTube videos. Users viewing the pages interact by placing decorative "beep" and "buzz" stickers on each other's pages, with each sticker serving as a clickable link to that visitor's page. Each user can design their own beep and buzz stickers, which are retroactively updated across the app. AI analysis at publish time ensures that pages and sticker content is safe. Content can be flagged as inappropriate, which is then reviewed by an admin.
