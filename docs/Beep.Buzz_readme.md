# Beep.Buzz

## Overview

Beep.Buzz is a creative social media platform that gives everyone their own customizable corner of the internet. At its heart, each user gets a personal page at their own subdomain (username.beep.buzz) where they can express themselves through an intuitive canvas-based system.

Think of it as a playful blend of a personal website and a digital guestbook. Users can design their pages with text, shapes, and YouTube videos, creating unique vertical scrolling experiences. The magic happens through "beep" and "buzz" stickers - interactive elements that visitors can place on each other's pages. Each sticker serves as both a form of interaction and a portal to the visitor's own page, creating an organic web of connections.

The platform emphasizes creative freedom while maintaining simplicity. Whether you're a casual user looking to create a fun personal space or a creative mind seeking a unique way to express yourself, Beep.Buzz provides an accessible yet powerful canvas for digital self-expression.

## Pages

### Home (/) (Public)

The home page serves as the central hub for discovering what's happening across Beep.Buzz. Users can explore pages through various curated sections including Popular Pages, Recently Active, and New Pages. A search function allows finding specific users or pages by title or username.

The discovery experience is enhanced with category filters, helping users find content that matches their interests. Each page is presented as a card showing the title, creator's username, a visual preview, and statistics about received stickers. For those feeling adventurous, a "Random" button provides serendipitous discoveries.

### Welcome (/welcome) (Public)

The welcome page provides a streamlined entry point to the Beep.Buzz community. Instead of traditional password-based login, users simply enter their email address to receive a secure magic link. This passwordless approach prioritizes both security and convenience.

### User Canvas (/[username]) (Public)

Every user's personal space on Beep.Buzz, accessible at username.beep.buzz. The page features a static header displaying the page title, creator information, and sticker statistics. A sticky navigation bar lets visitors toggle sticker visibility and add their own beeps and buzzes to the page.

The main canvas area showcases the creator's carefully arranged elements, with visitor stickers layered naturally throughout the space. Clicking any sticker reveals who placed it and provides a direct link to their page, creating an interconnected network of personal spaces.

### Canvas Editor (/edit) (User, Admin)

The creative heart of Beep.Buzz where users build their pages. The intuitive interface allows adding and arranging up to 20 elements including text blocks, shapes, dividers, and up to 3 YouTube embeds. Each element can be freely positioned, resized, and customized.

The editor includes responsive preview modes for desktop, tablet, and mobile views, ensuring pages look great on all devices. To maintain quality and fairness, pages are limited to 3000px in height, and visitors can place up to 50 stickers of each type.

### User Settings (/settings) (User)

The personal control center for managing your Beep.Buzz identity. Users can customize their signature beep and buzz stickers by selecting from various icon libraries and adjusting colors and background shapes. All changes automatically update across the platform wherever your stickers appear.

The settings page also provides valuable insights through an activity overview showing all pages where you've placed stickers, with easy navigation and management options. Analytics display total stickers received with detailed breakdowns to track your impact in the community.

### Admin (/admin) (Admin)

A comprehensive moderation interface for platform administrators. The page displays reported content queues, automatically hidden pages (triggered by 3+ reports), and tools for reviewing full page contents. Admins can approve content (unhiding pages and dismissing reports), permanently remove content, issue warnings, and manage user access. All moderation actions are logged for accountability.

## Authentication & Access Control

Beep.Buzz uses a modern, secure authentication system based on magic links. When users want to sign in, they simply enter their email address and receive a secure, time-limited link for instant access. This eliminates the need to remember passwords while maintaining strong security.

### Access Levels

Content and features are organized into three access tiers to ensure appropriate permissions while keeping the platform open and accessible.

- Home (/)
- Welcome (/welcome)
- User Canvas (/[username])

## User Experience

New visitors typically discover Beep.Buzz through shared page links or search engines, landing on a user's custom page or the home discovery feed. From there, they can explore other pages by clicking stickers or using the discovery tools on the home page.

Creating an account is as simple as entering an email address on the welcome page. Once authenticated, users can immediately start building their own page in the Canvas Editor, customizing their sticker identity in Settings, and joining the community by placing stickers on other pages they enjoy.

The platform encourages organic exploration through sticker-based navigation, creating natural paths of discovery as users follow trails of interactions from page to page.
