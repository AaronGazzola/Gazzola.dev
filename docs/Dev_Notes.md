  - Comment by @SilySlashLeon:
    - i understand the desire to "vibe code" in a language like JS, i agree with your sentiments regarding lowering the general input from other sources when it comes to software development. Do you get a feeling of satisfaction when following this methodology for coding? I use AI for help with tools, however as you have displayed in this video the tools are not up to standard for projects which require any sort of larger input, is the whole goal to just not write any lines of code? it would seem that editing your code from that results produced would actually work out quicker?
      I apologise if I am just out of the loop and this is a "vibe coding" challenge or something like that.....
    - Great question! Thanks for asking. I'll respond during today's live stream. The short answer is that working with AI has significantly increased both my development velocity and capacity. I can do a lot more, much faster, with less effort.
      I work full time on enterprise level projects with total test coverage, the apps I build professionally are much more rigorous than my live stream projects, but the process is similar.
      Thanks again for your comment, I hope to see you in a stream! ðŸ¤Ÿ
