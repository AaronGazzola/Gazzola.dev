- Create a test at "cypress/e2e/rls.cy.ts". Don't update other files.
- Don't run the test.
- Use a single "it()" method to run a single test in "rls.cy.ts". 
- Use an "exists" check for the success or error toast elements.
- Don't use "wait()" unless required.
- Use a 30 second timeout for each check.
- Refer to the RLS policies to determine if the test should expect to see a success or error toast, depending on the user role.
