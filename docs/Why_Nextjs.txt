- Backed by Vercel with enterprise support
- Used by Fortune 500s worldwide with proven track record
- Comprehensive solution: routing, API routes, authentication, middleware (no third-party libraries needed)

SECURITY & COMPLIANCE
- Built-in enterprise-grade security: action ID encryption, secure server-only code access, scoped mutations
- Server Actions keep sensitive logic server-side, reducing attack surface
- Robust authentication patterns prevent account takeovers and authorization breaches
- Content Security Policy support for compliance requirements

OPTIMIZATION & PERFORMANCE
- Turbopack for faster build speeds
- Automatic Static Optimization + Partial Prerendering for hybrid applications
- Built-in lazy loading, image optimization, code splitting, route prefetching
- Superior SEO with server-side rendering and static generation
- Fast initial static responses with dynamic content streaming

DEVELOPMENT PRODUCTIVITY
- Full-stack framework with opinionated structure streamlines team development
- Server Actions and API routes for backend functionality in same codebase
- TypeScript support with excellent type inference
- Extensive documentation and mature ecosystem
- Comprehensive testing integration (Jest, Playwright)

VS VITE + REACT ROUTER
- Integrated full-stack vs requiring multiple libraries
- Built-in SSR/SSG vs client-side only
- Production-ready vs requiring custom configuration
- Better for enterprise apps with authentication, APIs, complex routing
- More productivity through opinionated structure vs maximum flexibility
