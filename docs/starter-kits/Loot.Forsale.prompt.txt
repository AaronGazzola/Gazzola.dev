I need help setting up my Next.js project using my starter kit. Please work through these steps one at a time, pause to ask for my input only when needed:

1. CHECK IF STARTER KIT IS ALREADY UNPACKED
   - Check if the following files and folders exist in the project root:
     * documentation/ directory
     * CLAUDE.md file
     * .claude/settings.local.json file
   - If all three exist, SKIP TO STEP 3 (the starter kit is already unpacked)
   - If any are missing, continue to STEP 2

2. LOCATE AND UNPACK STARTER KIT
   - Search the repository for a directory or ZIP file name containing "Loot.ForSale_Starter_Kit" (it may have "(3)" or something similar appended)
   - If not found, ask me: "I couldn't find the Loot.ForSale_Starter_Kit. Please download it from AzAnything.dev and add it to your project directory, then let me know when it's ready."
   - Wait for my confirmation before proceeding

   UNPACKING INSTRUCTIONS:
   - If the starter kit is a ZIP file, extract it first
   - Move all contents from the starter kit directory to the project root:
     * documentation/ directory (and all contents) → root/documentation/
     * CLAUDE.md → root/CLAUDE.md
     * .claude/settings.local.json → root/.claude/settings.local.json
   - Verify all files and folders are in place
   - Delete the "Loot.ForSale_Starter_Kit" directory or zip file after extracting all contents

   IMPORTANT: After unpacking is complete, inform me: "The starter kit has been unpacked successfully. You now need to completely close this Claude Code chat and start a fresh chat to load the new permissions settings. Once you've started a new chat, paste this same prompt again and I'll continue from Step 3."

   STOP HERE - wait for me to create a new chat and paste the prompt again.

3. CHECK PREREQUISITES
   - Check if git and Node.js are installed by running: git --version && node --version
   - If git is missing: guide me to install it for my operating system
   - If Node.js is missing or version is below 18: direct me to download the LTS version from nodejs.org

4. INSTALL NEXT.JS
   - Once prerequisites are confirmed, install Next.js in the current directory
   - Use the command: npx create-next-app@latest . --no-tailwind --yes
   - This accepts all defaults (TypeScript, ESLint, App Router) but skips Tailwind so we can install v4 manually later
   - If there are files and/or directories in the root dir then first move them to a temporary directory, then run the create-next-app command, then replace them

5. CLEAN UP BOILERPLATE
   - After installation, help me delete unnecessary boilerplate files
   - Set up a clean initial project structure

6. Configure TypeScript Compiler

Update "tsconfig.json" to exclude template files from compilation:

- Open "tsconfig.json"
- Add "public/data/documentation/template_files" to the "exclude" array
- If no "exclude" array exists, create one at the root level of the JSON object

Example:
{
  "compilerOptions": { ... },
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "public/data/documentation/template_files"]
}


7. INITIAL COMMIT AND PUSH
   - Commit and push the changes
   - Note: I'm already authenticated with GitHub from when I cloned this repository
   - IMPORTANT: Confirm that the ".env.local" file is ignored by the ".gitignore"
   - Run git add . && git commit -m "Initial Next.js setup" && git push

8. CREATE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR PHASE 1
   - Read documentation/starter_kit.plan.phase1.md
   - Switch to plan mode and create a step-by-step plan from the instructions in that document

IMPORTANT: Follow the starter_kit.plan.phase1.md document exactly. It contains all the detailed instructions for Phase 1 (Tailwind and Shadcn configuration). After completing Phase 1, you will be directed to Phase 2 and Phase 3. DO NOT CHANGE THE IMPLEMENTATION ORDER - FOLLOW THE PLAN EXACTLY
